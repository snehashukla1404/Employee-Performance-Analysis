# Employee Performance Analysis

A data-driven project to analyze employee performance and optimize workforce management. It includes data preprocessing, visualization, and trend identification using Python libraries.

## ‚ú® Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualizations of performance metrics
- Statistical analysis for insights

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python 3.x
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

- **Employee_Performance_Analysis.ipynb**  # Main analysis notebook
- **Data/**  # Raw and processed datasets
- **requirements.txt**  # Dependencies
- **README.md**  # Documentation

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `scikit-learn`

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üöÄ Running the Application
To run the application and perform the analysis, use Jupyter notebook:
- Open a terminal or command prompt.
- Navigate to the project directory.
- Run the following command to start Jupyter Notebook:
  ```bash
  jupyter notebook Employee_Performance_Analysis.ipynb
  ```
- The notebook will open in your browser, where you can start analyzing the data and visualizing employee performance.

## üß© Future Improvements
- Machine Learning Models: Implement machine learning models such as decision trees or regression to predict employee performance.
- Enhanced Visualizations: Use interactive plots (e.g., Plotly or Dash) for better data insights.
- Real-Time Data Integration: Integrate with an employee database to perform live analysis on current data.
- Performance Reports: Automatically generate PDF/Excel reports with key findings from the analysis.
